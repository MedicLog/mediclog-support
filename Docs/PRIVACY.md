# MedicLog Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 17, 2026

## Overview
MedicLog is an EMS call logging application designed for emergency medical services personnel. This privacy policy explains how the app handles user data.

## Data Collection
MedicLog collects and stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

- **Call Session Data:** Incident numbers, timestamps, call duration
- **Medical Interventions:** Medications, procedures, vitals, IV access logged during calls
- **Device Information:** Device ID, device type (iPhone/Apple Watch) for multi-device sync
- **User Information:** Name, employee ID, unit number, agency name (entered by user)

## Data Storage
- All data is stored **locally** on your iOS device and Apple Watch
- **No cloud storage** - MedicLog does not upload data to external servers
- **No analytics** - MedicLog does not track usage or collect analytics
- **No third-party sharing** - Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it

## Data Sharing
- **User-Controlled Only:** You can export call logs via:
  - AirDrop to other devices
  - Email attachments
  - File sharing (.mlshare format)
- **Multi-Device Sync:** Data syncs between your paired iPhone and Apple Watch via local Bluetooth connection
- **You control all sharing** - the app never automatically transmits data

## Optional Features
- **GPS Location Tracking:** Optional feature (disabled by default). If enabled, GPS coordinates are logged with entries for scene documentation
- **Voice Recognition:** Optional feature for hands-free logging. Voice data is processed locally on-device only

## Data Security
- Data stored in iOS secure app container
- Protected by device passcode/Face ID/Touch ID
- Export files (.mlshare format) include integrity checksums

## HIPAA Compliance
**Important:** MedicLog is designed as a supplemental logging tool for EMS workflows. It is **not** a HIPAA-compliant electronic health record (EHR) system. Do not use MedicLog as your primary patient care reporting system. Always transfer documented information to your agency's official ePCR system.

## Data Retention
- Call history remains on device until manually deleted by user
- No automatic expiration or deletion of data
- User can delete individual calls or clear entire history

## Children's Privacy
MedicLog is intended for use by certified/licensed EMS professionals (18+). We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

## Changes to Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy. Changes will be posted with updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of changes.
